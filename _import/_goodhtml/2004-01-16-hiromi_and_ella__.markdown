So my friend and best fan in taiwan, <a href="http://home.kimo.com.tw/pzantique/">ella</a>, met with my roommate hiromi in taiwan. I sent a care package with hiromi for ella. she seemed to like her a care package - which is good.<br>

i hung out with morgan again last night. it was fn. we hung out with matt and edie and some of their friends. they played a bunch of games.. I showed morgan my yoyo work. it is funny - cuz I am sooooo nerdy.. yet strangely I feel the need to parade my nerdiness around like a rockstar, which is what I am. I have fans. ;)<br>
