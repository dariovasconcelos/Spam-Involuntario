So at lunch today we were talking about vegan food and I remembered this excellent vegan chocolate cake recipe that my family made for the holidays. It is so good. I remember when we had bunches of non-vegan cakes and pies - this one was always the first to get eaten (the majority of my family is not vegan). Soo good. Anyway - here is the recipe - straight from my mom:
<blockquote><strong>Chocolate Vegan Cake</strong> Ingredients:
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cup flour</li>
<li>1/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 cup cold water</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 teaspoon vinegar</li>
</ul>
Directions: Preheat oven 375 degrees. Use small brownie sized pan, (no greasing required.) Mix all dry ingredients right in pan. Mix all wet ingredients in a separate bowl EXCEPT VINEGAR, (IMPORTANT.) Add wet ingredients to dry and stir until all dry ingredients are mixed. Add vinegar quickly and stir in</blockquote>
