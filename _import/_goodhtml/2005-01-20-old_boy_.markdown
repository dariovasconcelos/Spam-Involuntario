old boy been working hard. dang dang darn.<br>
<br>
today I shoudl get my mac mini. so I planned for its arrival. I brought a fancy knife that I use to open things like apple computers, I brought a couple dual headed screwdrivers. and I brought a camera. I am ready t welcome the little guy into the new world. this has brought me to start thinking how silly the things I carry on my person are. so I decided that I woudl catalog everything that I carry on my person on the way to work. here it is:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><small>clothes (of course)</small></li>
<li><small>wallet</small></li>
<li><small>keys to my apartment</small></li>
<li><small>nokia 7610 phone</small></li>
<li><small>moonboots</small></li>
<li><small>hoody</small></li>
<li><small>glasses</small></li>
<li><small>burts beeswax</small></li>
<li><small>ipod mini</small></li>
<li><small>shure e2c headphones</small></li>
<li><small>richard ford - independence day</small></li>
<li><small>mini screw driver</small></li>
<li><small>regular sized screw driver</small></li>
<li><small>custom <a href="http://www.knifecenter.com/kc_new/store_detail.html?s=QN45EO">big chief knife</a> (customized by my brother while he was in dive school)</small></li>
<li><small>work pager</small></li>
<li><small>key card</small></li>
<li><small>work laptop</small></li>
</ul>

So yea. that is what I carried to work. I don't carry a bag or anything. I just stuff my pockets. I probably look like a dork. but who cares.<br>
<br>
so I am going to throw out their a smallish gripe. ever since I got the 7610 I have been really happy with my phone - however. it is a pain in the ass to upload pictures. because the pictures are ~1mp so they are a lot larger than I am used to. but it will take a good 15-20 minutes to upload a few pictures. sooooo annoying.<br>
<br>
if it was faster I would be posting pictures of my fancy new mac mini that came while writing this post ;).
