oh yea. last night was fun. we went and saw a band and then some really good djs at subtonic. nice nice. today has been pretty funny. some friends are hosting a party on the roof of their place - so we are helping with that. it is hilarious. a lot of nonsense. it rules. the party should be really silly. and by silly I mean insane. hopefully it will be a good 4th. hehe.
