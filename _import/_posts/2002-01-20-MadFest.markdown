So this weekend I went to an awesome juggling convention. It was called Madfest(<b>Mad</b>ison <b>Fest</b>ival). The jugglers there are some of the best in the entire world. They are all very nice and are quite talented.The show was incredible, the were at least 5 professional juggling acts and many more really great amateur acts. The MC was a lot better than QUad Cities and the humor was great. It was probably the best juggling show I have ever seen.<br/><br/>well I hope everyone has a good Marin Luther King, jr. day.
