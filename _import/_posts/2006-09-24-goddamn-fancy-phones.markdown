So i am on the train and i amd playing with my phone and i end up frying my sim card. apparently nokia has some security implementations that will fry your sim card if you enter the pin code wrong more than 5 times and then enter the PUK code wrong more than 10 times. So i called tmobile and they were like "you are screwed." So i am sad. nobody can call and i can't get txt messages. so screwed. haha

So now i am in tags car - using his fancy internet. with a toasted phone. someday. my prince will come.
