I am excited to be a part of Venture Hacks helping them find amazing startups for the [Angels on the Angellist](http://angel.co). The scout program is going to be a lot of fun and hopefully will allow some great startups to be funded by the amazing angels from the angel list. Check out this [great write up in GigaOm](http://gigaom.com/2010/08/31/angellist-designates-scouts-to-refer-new-startup-deals/).

If you have a startup that you want to submit to the angellist, you can do so yourself by [submitting directly to the angel list](http://angel.co/intro). If you want more information about the angel list, or would like me to take a look at your startup (and get all the perks of interacting with a person as amazing as myself - hah) - then send an [email to me directly](http://harperreed.org/contact). I am pretty easy to contact and can help out in many ways. 

I am looking to help out and interact with midwest startups. I am very serious about making sure that Chicago continues to be a good place to be an entrepreneur. Having venturehack/angel list representation in Chicago will continue to help the community. Be sure an check out the [listing for Chicago Angels](http://angel.co/chicago). 

Making the Midwest/Chicago a great place for starting a company isnâ€™t just for people like myself, the [groupon guys](http://www.lightbank.com), [sandbox](http://www.sandboxindustries.com) and the angels. It is about the entrepreneur as well. Please let me know if you have ideas, concerns or just general insights into making the Midwest/Chicago the best place to start a company. 

If you are outside of the Chicago/Midwest area - feel free to ping me anyway. I am always looking for new startups to talk to and people to connect.
