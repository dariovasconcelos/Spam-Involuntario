I meant to post this months ago. hah. For some reason, it didn't quite make it live. Then a couple days ago, I was talking to a friend about his recent move to Lincoln Square. We spent some time talking about great places to go eat and hang out, and I remembered this post. I thought I would get it up and out there. 

A couple months ago, Hiromi and I moved from Lincoln Square to Wicker Park. We had wanted to live in Wicker Park for many years and since we have nothing keeping us in Lincoln Square - we decided to go ahead and move. 

Lincoln Square was awesome. 

I really enjoyed living there for the 3 years we were there. The neighborhood was awesome. The people were great. The nightlife was... well, there was a bunch of great restaurants. ;)

I wanted to take a minute to chronicle the places we went to a bunch and the places we liked. Hopefully this list will helpful to someone. These are all the places I will miss. 

* [Jury’s](http://www.jurysrestaurant.com/) - This place is insane. It has great hamburgers, great food and great service. It also has one of the strangest crowds in Lincoln Square. Always makes me chuckle. 
* [Drew’s Eatery](http://www.drewseatery.com/) - I like drew. He is nice. His eatery is a great place to get an afternoon snack or quick dinner. Very vegan friendly. This is key. They have Italian beef sandwiches. It isn’t often you can go to a vegan friendly place and order an Italian beef sandwich. I enjoy their water in a box. 
* [The Globe](http://www.theglobepub.com/) - I think i went here 500 times for lunch with the SkinnyTech crew. It is a good place to watch people, football, rugby or have cheese fries. 
* [Cafe28](http://www.cafe28.org/) - I love cafe 28. I suggest you go there immediately. 
* [Delicious Cafe](http://www.adeliciousvegancafe.com/) - another vegan friendly place in the area. They have great vegan sandwiches and sweets. They often host dinners and other special vegan events. 
*[Rosded](http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-leland-ave/2308/-rosded-restaurant?gl=us) - This is my favorite Thai place. It is cheap, good and small - as all thai places should be. 
* [Costellos](http://www.costellosandwich.com/) - makes good sandwiches. We often walked there on an afternoon. It is always packed with families. 
* [Half Acre Brewery](http://www.halfacrebeer.com/) - a recent addition to the neighborhood. It is a great way to grab a growler for a party or BYOB place. 
*[Mythos](http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-montrose-ave/2030/-mythos-restaurant?hl=en&gl=us) - Mythos is insane. I love every bit of it. If you are a fan of Greek foods and like BYOB then this place is for you. Mix it with some wine or the aforementioned Half Acre growler. 
* [Glenn’s](http://www.glennsdiner.com/) - I think this is one of my favorite places in Lincoln Square. It is hilariously packed. Make a reservation. 
* [Mertz](http://www.merzapothecary.com/) - this is for hiromi and hippies. They have nice soap. 
* [Hazel](http://store.hazelchicago.com/) - A nice gift store/nick nack store. A great place for picking up gifts or party favors. I recommend it. We got many good items here. The people are always nice and they do gift wrapping. 
* [First Slice cafe](http://www.firstslice.org/) - another great lunch spot. Out of the way. tasty and nice. 
* [Cho Sun Ok](http://chosunokrestaurant.com/) - The insane people who went here took ALL of our parking spots, always. But for good reason. this is a great korean place.
* [Davis Theatre](http://www.google.com/movies?hl=en&near=Chicago&dq=davis+theatre&theater=davis) - It is like a grindhouse theatre mixed with yuppies. A great place to see a cheap movie. 

I imagine I missed a bunch of great places. If you have any favs, leave them in the comments. 

I really like Lincoln Square. I think we would live there again.
