It has been about nine months since I last posted on this blog. I promise I haven't completely forgotten about it. I am so busy that when I have a quick second to  think about posting - I am suddenly thinking about the next thing and the thoughts about my blog have disappeared.

I am busy because of the awesome work I am doing with all the amazing people at [Obama for America](http://barackobama.com). Although, I miss writing articles about my coding and traveling, I love (and more importantly believe in) the work we are doing. 

I will attempt to write a meaningful post soon (hah. who am I kidding. It will be many moons before I post again!). In the meantime, please feel free to [hit me up](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@harper+yo) on twitter (I am  [@harper](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=harper)), check out the [books I am reading](https://harperreed.org/books) and give to my [personal fundraising page](https://donate.barackobama.com/page/outreach/view/2012/harper).
