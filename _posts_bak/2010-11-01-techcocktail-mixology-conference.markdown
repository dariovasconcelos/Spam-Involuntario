On October 28th, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Tech Cocktail Startup Mixology Conference. It was a fun quick conference with a set of amazing speakers. 

Below is my talk. I spoke about fostering a community of problem solvers. Here are my [slides](https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dd3wvxq5_649fzcvqpvz&interval=5&autoStart=true).

Would love to know your thoughts. 

I am excited to see Tech Cocktail grow. I have been going to TC for years now. Threadless sponsored the first TC in boulder, we had tables at various TC's in Chicago. Scott and I did a really amazing presentation on printers at the first TC conference. It has been awesome. I can't wait to see what Frank has in store for TC next.
